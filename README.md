This repo contains some header-only utility libraries implemented mainly for personal use.
All libraries are independent and can be just copied into existing projects individually.
C++20 is required.

Currently implemented:\
	- logging (multiple log levels, output destinations, source info, formatting)\
	- constexpr string hash
