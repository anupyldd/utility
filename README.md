This repo contains some header-only utility libraries implemented for practice or personal use.
All headers are independent and can be just copied into existing projects individually.
C++20 is required.

Currently implemented:<br />
	- logging (multiple log levels, output destinations, source info, formatting)<br />
	- constexpr string hash<br />
	- templated linked list (access, search, insertion)<br />
	- custom assertions and exceptions
